# ViewNavigation

A navigation library of View ui system which not supported in jetpack navigation.

- support DSL to build a navigation graph.
- support build View Router with View, ViewBinding and ViewController (something like light fragment).
- support args / stack restore when Activity recreate.
- support coroutine by using a job binding view lifecycle.

If you need to write so many logic in a router, I recommend you to use Navigation for fragment.
